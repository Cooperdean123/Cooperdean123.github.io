    <h1>Why i like to go swimming in summer</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my most favoriate activity in the summer. If the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but its mine.</p>

    <ul>
<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
<li>I have the oppurtinity to be in the sun</li>
    </ul>
